# Keep Your GitHub Profile Green

This repository contains an automated GitHub Action that runs every day, makes a small change, and pushes it to your repository to keep your profile active.

## Disclaimer:  
This workflow modifies your repository automatically. By using this repository, you take full responsibility for how it's used. I am not responsible for any consequences of running this workflow or any changes it makes to your repository.  
#### I personally have it turned off. You can check my commit history from my profile.

## üõ† How to Set It Up

### 1. Clone This Repository

Since GitHub does not generate contribution graphs for forked repositories, you‚Äôll need to create your own repository:

1. **Clone this repository locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/desujoy/lifemeter
   ```
2. **Create a new repository on GitHub** under your account.
3. **Push the cloned repository to your new repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/new-repo-name.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 2. Check Your GitHub Action Permissions

For the workflow to work, GitHub Actions needs permission to push changes to your repository. Here's how you can check and configure your permissions:

1. Go to your **repository settings**.
2. Scroll down to **Actions**.
3. Ensure that **Read and write permissions** are enabled under **Workflow permissions**.  
   - This allows the action to push changes back to your repository.

### 3. Sit Back and Relax üòé

That's it! The workflow will run every day at midnight UTC, append the current date to a file, and push the change. You don‚Äôt have to do anything.

The daily updates will ensure that your GitHub contribution graph remains green, even if you're not actively pushing code.

## üîÑ How to Trigger the Action Manually

If you want to trigger the workflow manually (for example, to test it), follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
2. Select the **Keep Me Alive** workflow.
3. Click on **Run workflow** to manually trigger the workflow.

## ‚õîÔ∏è How to Turn It Off (And Why You Should)

Keeping your contribution graph green can be fun, but after a while, you may want to turn it off. Here‚Äôs why:

1. **Cluttered commit history**: Over time, your repository will accumulate many trivial commits, making the history hard to follow.
2. **False representation of activity**: It might look like you're more active than you actually are, which can be misleading.

### How to Disable the Workflow:

GitHub allows you to **disable workflows** without deleting them. This way, you can pause the workflow temporarily and re-enable it later if you want.

To disable the workflow:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab of your repository.
2. Select the **Keep Me Alive** workflow.
3. Click on the **‚Ä¶** (three dots) menu on the top-right.
4. Select **Disable workflow**.

You can re-enable it at any time by following the same steps and selecting **Enable workflow**.
